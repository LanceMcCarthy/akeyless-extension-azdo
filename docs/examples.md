# Examples - Tutorial Walkthrough

Instead of a few disjoined examples, I thought it would be better to walk you through a tutorial that you can follow along with. This walkthrough will take you through:

1. Using the Azure CLI task to get a JWT token
2. Fetch secrets from Akeyless
3. Confirm the secrets were as expected

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have things set up and want to see what to expect, you can jump right down to the [real use screenshots](#real-use-screenshots) section.
> - [Static Secret Requests](#static-secret-requests)
> - [Dynamic Secret Requests](#dynamic-secret-requests)

## Prerequisite

So that you can follow this tutorial exactly, in Akeyless, you want to create a new static secret in your personal vault.

- Set the secret's name to: `azdo-test-secret`
- Set the secret's value to: `These Are Not The Droids You Are Looking For`

![setting demo secret](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/akeyless-extension-azdo/assets/3520532/d10497ca-3cd6-4283-b10f-fb472c84c276)

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, the path to the secret depends on where you saved it. Since I put it in my personal vault, the path is `/personal-keys/mccarthy/azdo-test-secret`. Yours will have your name instead of 'mccarthy'. Keep this in mind if you copy/paste from the snippets!

## Task 1 - Azure CLI

To start the workflow, we need an Azure CLI Task to fetch a new short-lived JWT token. Since this is a sensitive value, we want to safely pass the JWT to a subsequent step.

This is done using the `##vso[task.setvariable]` command, which has three parameters:

- `variable` - this is the name of the variable
- `isoutput` - determines if the variable will be an output
- `issecret` - determines if the variable's value is a secret

Here's how it is used:

```powershell
# Step 1 - Get a short-lived JWT from the Azure service principal
$JWT=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken --output tsv)

# Step 2 - set the JWT as a secret output variable
# the variable's name is set to "azure_jwt", then isoutput=true, and issecret=true
echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=azure_jwt;isoutput=true;issecret=true]$JWT"
```

Therefore, here is what the full task should look like:

```yml
- task: AzureCLI@2
  name: 'AzureCLI'
  displayName: 'Get JWT from Azure'
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'Your-Service-Principal-Name-Goes-Here'
    scriptType: ps
    scriptLocation: inlineScript
    inlineScript: |
     # 1. Get JWT
     $JWT=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken --output tsv)

     # 2. Set the JWT as a secret output variable
     echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=azure_jwt;isoutput=true;issecret=true]$JWT"
```

## Task 2 - The Akeyless Task

Now, we can use the JWT token to authenticate with Akeyless. Let's add the Akeyless Task and provide three things:

- The Akeyless Auth Method's `access-id` (seen in [Getting Started - Akeyless Setup](/docs/getting-started.md#akeyless-setup) - **Step 1**).
- The JWT token from Task 1.
- The secrets you want to fetch from Akeyless

Remember, the path to the secret in akeyless is `/personal-keys/mccarthy/azdo-test-secret`. In the snippet below, I have chosen `OBI_WAN` to be the name for the output, but you can use any valid string (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, _).

```yml
- task: akeyless-secrets@1
  name: 'Akeyless1'
  displayName: 'Get Secrets from Akeyless'
  inputs:
    accessid: 'p-123456'
    azureJwt: '$(AzureCLI.azure_jwt)'
    staticSecrets: '{"/personal-keys/mccarthy/azdo-test-secret":"OBI_WAN" }'
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using classic pipelines, it is **critical** that you set the `Reference Name` setting of the task in your pipeline, this will be used to reference your outputs instead of an `id` that YAML pipelines have.

## Task 3 - Verifying the Secret

Since this is a sample, and we know the value that we are expecting from Akeyless, we can have a little fun with checking the value:

```yaml
- name: "Verify Jedi Status"
  powershell: |
    # Te secret output fomr the Akeyless
    $passphrase = "$(Akeyless1.OBI_WAN)"

    # This is what we are expecting
    $expected = "These Are Not The Droids You Are Looking For"

    # to finish this demo, lets verify they match to prove everything is working
    if ($passphrase -eq $expected){
        echo "The passphrase matches, welcome Jedi"
    }
    else{
        echo "Sorry, no match... you must be a Sith!"
    }
```

### Combined

Here's what all the steps look like together

```YAML
steps:
- task: AzureCLI@2
  name: 'AzureCLI'
  displayName: 'Get JWT from Azure'
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'Your-Service-Principal-Name-Goes-Here'
    scriptType: ps
    scriptLocation: inlineScript
    inlineScript: |
     $JWT=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken --output tsv)
     echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=azure_jwt;isoutput=true;issecret=true]$JWT"

- task: akeyless-secrets@1
  name: 'Akeyless1'
  displayName: 'Get Secrets from Akeyless'
  inputs:
    accessid: 'p-123456'
    azureJwt: '$(AzureCLI.azure_jwt)'
    staticSecrets: '{"/personal-keys/mccarthy/azdo-test-secret":"OBI_WAN" }'

- name: "Verify Jedi Status"
  powershell: |
    $passphrase = "$(Akeyless1.OBI_WAN)"
    $expected = "These Are Not The Droids You Are Looking For"
    if ($passphrase -eq $expected){
        echo "The passphrase matches, welcome Jedi"
    }
    else{
        echo "Sorry, no match... you must be a Sith!"
    }
```

and finally, after you run the pipeline, the output of the Verify task will be:

![final outcome](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/akeyless-extension-azdo/assets/3520532/683a15d8-0728-40d9-9ea8-2fd9359f8190)

## Conclusion and Real World Example

In the real-world, you would not be using that "verify jedi status" step that leaks your secret in plain text. So, to share a real example, here's what it would look like to set a private nuget server's package source credentials using two separate static secrets.

```yaml
- task: akeyless-secrets@1
  name: 'Akeyless1'
  displayName: 'Get Secrets from Akeyless'
  inputs:
    accessid: 'p-123456'
    azureJwt: '$(AzureCLI.azure_jwt)'
    staticSecrets: '{"/path/to/secrets/TELERIK_USERNAME":"TELERIK_ACCOUNT_USERNAME", "/path/to/secrets/TELERIK_PASSWORD":"TELERIK_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD" }'

- powershell: |
    dotnet nuget update source 'Telerik_Feed' `
       --source 'https://nuget.telerik.com/v3/index.json' `
       --username '$(Akeyless1.TELERIK_ACCOUNT_USERNAME)' `
       --password '$(Akeyless1.TELERIK_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD)' `
       --configfile 'src\NuGet.Config' `
       --store-password-in-clear-text
  displayName: 'Set Telerik NuGet Credentials'
```

### Real Use Screenshots

Here are some real runs of the demo pipeline, to help you know what to expect in your pipeline's output.

#### Static Secret Requests

When requesting static secrets, you will see what was requested, what was returned and what output variable are available (secrest are masked in logs)

<img width="813" height="413" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a1d4f2-5cb8-4891-9f2a-4eb2c6862710" />

This is a very helpful reference, because you can use that secret's output variable name in a subsequent step. As a pro-tip, I recommend creating a quick powershell step to verify the variable is present and has a value (secrets are masked). That way you can continue with the rest of your pipeline's step with the confidence that there is a value present for your later requirements.

```powershell
Write-Host "Output 1 (nuget_key): $(AkeylessStatic.nuget_key)"
Write-Host "Output 2 (docker_hub_un): $(AkeylessStatic.docker_hub_un)"
Write-Host "Output 3 (apple_acct_un): $(AkeylessStatic.apple_acct_un)"
```

When that runs, you will see the following result:

<img width="248" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/310ccb3f-9b25-47f7-adca-f7a119d0a0b0" />

#### Dynamic Secret Requests

##### Automatic Outputs

When requesting dynamic secrets, you will see very helpful information in the logs about how the automatically generated outputs were created:

<img width="908" height="786" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afc02103-28d9-40e1-b001-a9ff322b8932" />

This is a very helpful reference, because you can use those output variable names in a subsequent step. As a pro-tip, I recommend creating a quick powershell step to verify the variable is present and has a value (secrets are masked). That way you can continue with the rest of your pipeline's step with the confidence that there is a value present for your later requirements.

```powershell
Write-Host "üß™ TEST 1 - Verify mySqlSecret's autogenerated outputs..."
Write-Output "mySqlSecret_id: $(AkeylessDynamic.mySqlSecret_id)"
Write-Output "mySqlSecret_password: $(AkeylessDynamic.mySqlSecret_password)"
Write-Output "mySqlSecret_ttl_in_minutes: $(AkeylessDynamic.mySqlSecret_ttl_in_minutes)"
Write-Output "mySqlSecret_user: $(AkeylessDynamic.mySqlSecret_user)"
Write-Host "üèÅ---------------------------üèÅ"

Write-Host "üß™ TEST 2 - myEntraSecret's autogenerated outputs..."
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_id_secret_name: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_id_secret_name)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_id_secret_key_id: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_id_secret_key_id)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_msg: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_msg)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_secret_appId: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_secret_appId)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_secret_displayName: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_secret_displayName)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_secret_endDateTime: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_secret_endDateTime)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_secret_keyId: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_secret_keyId)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_secret_secretText: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_secret_secretText)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_secret_tenantId: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_secret_tenantId)"
Write-Output "myEntraSecret_ttl_in_minutes: $(AkeylessDynamic.myEntraSecret_ttl_in_minutes)"
Write-Host "üèÅ---------------------------üèÅ"
```

When that runs, you will see:

<img width="513" height="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed73a5c-deff-409d-9d40-4098ad328640" />


##### Plain Output

If you are not using automatically generated outputs and instead want to manually process the entire plain output, then you can have something like this powershell:

```powershell
- powershell: |
    Write-Host "üß™ TEST 1 - Parse mySqlSecret's plain output..."

    # parse the json string
    $sql = $env:SQL_SECRET_JSON | ConvertFrom-Json

    # write out a list of all the properties
    Write-Host "Available properties: $($sql.PSObject.Properties.Name -join ', ')"

    # try a couple items to confirm
    Write-Host "user: $($sql.user)"
    Write-Host "password: $($sql.password)"
    Write-Host "ttl_in_minute: $($sql.ttl_in_minute)"
    Write-Host "id: $($sql.id)"
  displayName: 'Parse json'
  env:
    SQL_SECRET_JSON: $(AkeylessDynamic.mySqlSecret)
```

Which would output this result:

<img width="398" height="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de22d88-a35f-4bce-9d53-8dc1af3ece23" />

> If you are asking why the output is used with an `env` instead of inline script, [please carefuly read the Caution note](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/akeyless-extension-azdo/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#plain-output) to understand PowerShell's limitations with JSON.
